## Why i chose this project

Whilst learning web development i have always had this burning desire to make my own person blog where i can freely express my self, share tech news, and many more. This hackerthon gave me that opportunity to leverage all what i have learnt so far and was quite challenging, having taken 2 tutorials 3D dev profile @JSMastery and Nike landing page @JSMastery, having learn express js within within this hackerthon's timeframe


## What are my future plans
I would really love to see how i could improve on this project, what features to add, remove or update, i want to see how far i can really get with this!

## MISC
Well, tho i have faced many constraints, i am so glad i could atleast submit a working version of this project... I live in a weird place where power outages are more likely (about 60% of the time we are in a power outage) and this caused me to loose alot of time which i could use to fine tune my project, but i am happy i could atleast participate xd
I decided to, just about 5 days to the end of the hackerthon....

## Special Thanks
I'm super greatful to @JSMastery like you guys thought me every single thingy i currently know about web developement
